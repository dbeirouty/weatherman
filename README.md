# App name

Weatherman seeks to give you local up-to-date temperature readings and local timezone information in your Zendesk sidebar.

Weatherman is an ongoing personal project for the author. I will build out this app to increase it's feature list (within reason) to increase my knowledge in integrating various APIs into a JS app.

### The following information is displayed:

* Local weather
* Local time/zone
* [Future] Local news

Please submit bug reports to [DB](mailto:danalive@gmail.com).
